you can:

 - create projects

 # What is it's goal?

 When teaching software architecture I am often asked for examples of how decoupling works, 
 where to draw application boundary lines and how I would approach solving a problem. 

 This small project serves as a demonstration of taking a simple concept but through well defined
 business rules and application boundaries can have its features extended easily. 

 # How do I use this project?

 It is a standard .net framework application and can be opened in your .Net IDE of choice. 
 It was developed in rider.
